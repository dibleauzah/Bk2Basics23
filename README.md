Back to the Basics of Web-Dev

After resisting practice and a full-grasp attempt at (what I thought was) the "boring" basic-trio of web-apps (HTML-CSS-JS), I finally relented.
Humble-pie alert: I was wrong!

In a nutshell thus, the main goal of this project is to help myself to finally get a full intermediate-to-advanced practical ability with what I jokingly call "the trouble-trio" of web-design.

Wish me luck, and/or--better yet, please keep taking a glance at the repo, as I accomplish my goal, slowly-but-surely.
